The following terraform files show different examples of how to implement terraform:

* airflow.example.tf - Default Terraform installation. Works for most accounts with minimal modification
* airflom.multi.tf - Use this example to execute multiple copies of Airflow within an account and environment. Most 
                     likely will only be used in CDM
* airflow-sandbox.tf - Used in training sessions with PE's and Data Engineers. Should not be expected to be long lived.
